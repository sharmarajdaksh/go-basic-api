## A basic REST API with Go

Go is really neat! Looking forward to working more with Go.

So simple that it just works with in-memory data. No Databases yet. Maybe next time.

Need to learn how to work with databases in Go; also need to learn folder structure and code organization best practices for Go. All in good time.
